# OpenGL_The_Cherno_Tutorial
A sandbox for me to get hands-on experience with the OpenGL graphics API. 
I will follow the tutorials by The Cherno on YouTube at this link:

I may modify/add things to the project as I experiment with OpenGL.

The project will build towards x64 architectures. I will also prefer to statically link x64 libraries when possible.

I do not claim to have written GLFW or GLEW.
