# OpenGL_The_Cherno_Tutorial
* A sandbox for me to get hands-on experience with the OpenGL graphics API and some useful graphics libraries. 

* I will follow the tutorials by The Cherno on the YouTube playlist at this link:

* I may modify/add things to the project outside the scope of the tutorial as I experiment with OpenGL. I'll have [Outside Tutorial] in the summary of these commits.

* The project will build towards x64 architectures. I will also prefer to statically link x64 libraries when possible.

* Commits that perform library linking, include directory addition, and/or preprocessor constant modification do so in the OpenGL_Project/OpenGL_Project.vcxproj file (since I am using Visual Studio). These changes are often listed multiple times since they are done for all configurations.
